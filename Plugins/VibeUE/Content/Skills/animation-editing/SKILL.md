description: Preview, validate, and bake bone-rotation edits on AnimSequences with constraint awareness and retarget safety. Use when the user asks to edit/pose/adjust an animation's bones, raise an arm, create a swing/wave/dance/pose, mirror or copy a pose, set joint limits, or learn bone constraints. Load together with animsequence (keyframes) and skeleton (structure).

> 🧠 **Brains complement:** IF an `unreal-engine-skills-manager` tool (external MCP) exists in this session, call it with `{action: "load", skill: "animation-system"}` for UE domain knowledge on this topic — correct APIs, architecture, best practices — and treat it as the rubric for any review / "best practices" question. If no such tool is available (e.g. running under Claude Code or Codex without that MCP), skip this line entirely and proceed with this skill alone — do NOT attempt the call.

# Animation Editing Skill

Covers the **profile → preview → validate → bake** workflow for safe bone edits with correct
bone-space handling and constraint validation.

> **Load companion skills:** `animsequence` (basic keyframe creation), `skeleton` (structure, sockets,
> retargeting), `animation-blueprint` (state machines / AnimGraph). Common combo:
> `vibeue-skills-manager(action="load", skill_names=["animation-editing", "animsequence"])`.

> **🛡️ Safe discovery — never `unreal.load_asset()` in loops (memory crash 0xC0000005).**
> Use `SkeletonService.list_skeletons(path)`, `AnimSequenceService.find_animations_for_skeleton(skeleton)`,
> `AnimSequenceService.list_anim_sequences(path, skeleton_filter)` — they query metadata without loading.

## ⚠️ Critical Rules

### 1. Always specify bone space
Every bone rotation must state its coordinate space. **Default to `"local"` for user intent.**

| Space | Relative to | Use for |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `"local"` | parent bone | most edits (default) |
| `"component"` | mesh root | cross-bone coordination |
| `"world"` | world | rarely |

```python
unreal.AnimSequenceService.preview_bone_rotation(path, "upperarm_r", unreal.Rotator(0, 30, 0), "local", 0)
```

### 2. Use preview → validate → bake (never edit blind)
```python
ass = unreal.AnimSequenceService
ass.preview_bone_rotation(anim_path, "upperarm_r", unreal.Rotator(0, 45, 0), "local", 0)
v = ass.validate_pose(anim_path, True)             # True = learned constraints
if v.is_valid:
    ass.bake_preview_to_keyframes(anim_path, 0, -1, "cubic")
else:
    ass.cancel_preview(anim_path)                  # or accept clamped values
```

### 3. Build a skeleton profile before editing
```python
profile = unreal.SkeletonService.create_skeleton_profile("/Game/SK_Mannequin")
if not profile.has_learned_constraints:
    unreal.SkeletonService.learn_from_animations("/Game/SK_Mannequin", 50, 10)
```
Without a profile there are no constraints to validate against.

### 4. Euler for intent, quaternions internally
Express user intent as `unreal.Rotator(roll, pitch, yaw)` (degrees); the service uses quaternions
internally to avoid gimbal lock. Inspect with `quat_to_euler(quat)`. Don't guess axis orientation —
read the reference pose first (`get_reference_pose`).

## Sub-docs

- **`workflows.md`** — step-by-step workflows for every task above.
- **`api-reference.md`** — full SkeletonService/AnimSequenceService method list + data structures.
- **`common-mistakes.md`** — bone-space, validation, axis-guessing, and the load-in-loops crash.

## Verification

Confirm `AnimationEditResult.success` and inspect `was_clamped`; gate baking on
`validate_pose(...).is_valid`; `cancel_preview` on failure; `save_asset` after a successful bake.
