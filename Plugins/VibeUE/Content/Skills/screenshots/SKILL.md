description: Capture screenshots of the editor window, viewports, and asset editors for AI vision analysis (ScreenshotService). Use when the user asks you to look at / see / show the editor, verify something visually, capture a material or blueprint editor, or when you need vision to confirm a change. Pair captures with attach_image.

# Screenshot & Vision Skill

## Methods

| Method | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| `capture_editor_window(path)` | **DEFAULT — use this for everything.** Synchronous. Captures the whole editor window including any open tab (level viewport, Blueprint, Material, etc.) |
| `capture_active_window(path)` | Whatever window is currently focused |
| `get_active_window_title()` | Check what's in focus |
| `get_open_editor_tabs()` | List open asset editors |
| `capture_viewport(path, w, h)` | ❌ **DO NOT USE from Python** — asynchronous, file never appears on disk during a Python call. Returns `success=False` with an explanation. |

## Camera Best Practices for Screenshots

**Capture the current view by default — do NOT move the camera unless the user explicitly asks you to frame something a specific way.** Moving the camera is disruptive and requires the user to manually reset their view.

### When to Adjust Camera
- **Only** when the user explicitly says "show me X from above", "frame the landscape", or similar
- When taking verification screenshots of specific actors (e.g., water planes, splines)
- Never adjust the camera automatically as part of a general screenshot workflow
- The user's current viewport position is intentional — respect it

### Preferred: Use ActorService Camera View Methods

The `ActorService` provides methods to calculate and apply camera positions that frame actors:

```python
import unreal

actor_service = unreal.ActorService

# Move viewport camera to frame an actor from a specific direction
# Use unreal.ViewDirection (NOT unreal.EViewDirection — that prefix does not exist)
# Directions: TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT, FRONT, BACK
view = actor_service.get_actor_view_camera("MyLandscape", unreal.ViewDirection.TOP)
# Camera is now positioned — take screenshot immediately

# Calculate view without moving camera (for planning)
view = actor_service.calculate_actor_view("MyActor", unreal.ViewDirection.FRONT, 1.5)
# view.camera_location, view.camera_rotation available
# Apply when ready:
actor_service.set_viewport_camera(view.camera_location, view.camera_rotation)

# Directly set camera to any position/rotation (avoid this — easy to miss the subject)
actor_service.set_viewport_camera(
    unreal.Vector(1000, 2000, 500),
    unreal.Rotator(pitch=-45)   # ⚠️ Rotator positional order is (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) — always use kwargs
)
```

> ⚠️ **Critical**: Always use `unreal.ViewDirection.FRONT` — **never** `unreal.EViewDirection.FRONT`. The `E` prefix does **not** exist and will raise `AttributeError`.
>
> ⚠️ **Avoid guessing camera coordinates** with `set_viewport_camera`. Manual positions like `Vector(1200,-1200,600)` almost always capture only sky or empty space. Always prefer `get_actor_view_camera` which auto-calculates position from the actor's bounding box.
>
> For a diagonal/3-quarter view, use `calculate_actor_view` to get real bounds first, then offset from that position using trig — **never** guess coordinates. See the `level-actors` skill for the diagonal camera pattern.

**View directions:**
| Direction | Camera Position | Looking |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| `TOP` | Above actor | Straight down (-Z) |
| `BOTTOM` | Below actor | Straight up (+Z) |
| `LEFT` | Left of actor (-Y) | Toward +Y |
| `RIGHT` | Right of actor (+Y) | Toward -Y |
| `FRONT` | Front of actor (+X) | Toward -X |
| `BACK` | Behind actor (-X) | Toward +X |

**Padding multiplier**: 1.0 = tight fit, 1.2 = 20% padding (default), 2.0 = double distance
Camera distance is automatically calculated from the actor's bounding box to fit it in view.

### FCameraViewInfo Result
- `success` (bool) - Whether calculation succeeded
- `camera_location` (Vector) - Calculated camera position
- `camera_rotation` (Rotator) - Calculated camera rotation
- `view_direction` (ViewDirection) - Direction used
- `actor_center` (Vector) - Actor bounds center
- `actor_extent` (Vector) - Actor bounds half-extent
- `view_distance` (float) - Distance from camera to actor center

### Legacy: Direct Camera Positioning (for custom angles)

Use `UnrealEditorSubsystem` to get/set the viewport camera:

```python
import unreal

editor_subsys = unreal.get_editor_subsystem(unreal.UnrealEditorSubsystem)

# Get current camera
camera_info = editor_subsys.get_level_viewport_camera_info()
if camera_info:
    cam_loc, cam_rot = camera_info

# Set camera to a new position/rotation
new_location = unreal.Vector(x, y, z)
new_rotation = unreal.Rotator(pitch=pitch, yaw=yaw, roll=roll)  # ⚠️ positional order is (Roll, Pitch, Yaw) — always use kwargs
editor_subsys.set_level_viewport_camera_info(new_location, new_rotation)
```

### Focus on Actor Helper (only use when explicitly requested)

```python
import unreal

def frame_actor_for_screenshot(actor, distance=500.0, pitch=-25.0):
    """Position camera to look at an actor from a good angle."""
    editor_subsys = unreal.get_editor_subsystem(unreal.UnrealEditorSubsystem)

    # Get actor bounds for center point
    origin, extent = actor.get_actor_bounds(False)

    # Position camera behind and above, looking at the actor
    yaw = 0.0  # Face default direction; adjust as needed
    rot = unreal.Rotator(pitch, yaw, 0.0)
    forward = rot.get_forward_vector()
    cam_loc = origin - (forward * distance)

    editor_subsys.set_level_viewport_camera_info(cam_loc, rot)
```

---

## Workflows

### Take Screenshot and Analyze (Recommended — use this every time)

```python
import unreal

# capture_editor_window is synchronous — file is ready immediately after the call
result = unreal.ScreenshotService.capture_editor_window("my_capture")
# Path is auto-normalized: saves to ProjectSaved/VibeUE/Screenshots/my_capture.png

if result.success:
    print(f"SCREENSHOT_SAVED: {result.file_path}")
```

After executing, use `attach_image(file_path=result.file_path)` to analyze.

> ⚠️ **NEVER use `capture_viewport` from Python.** It queues a write for the next engine render frame,
> which will not occur while Python is running on the game thread. The file will never appear on disk.
> `capture_viewport` now returns `success=False` with an explanation — if you see that, switch to
> `capture_editor_window` immediately. **Do NOT retry `capture_viewport`.**

### Check What User Is Viewing

```python
import unreal

tabs = unreal.ScreenshotService.get_open_editor_tabs()
for tab in tabs:
    print(f"{tab.tab_label} ({tab.tab_type})")

if unreal.ScreenshotService.is_editor_window_active():
    print("Editor is focused")
else:
    print(f"Focused: {unreal.ScreenshotService.get_active_window_title()}")
```

## Data Structures

### ScreenshotResult
- `success` (bool)
- `file_path` (str)
- `message` (str) - Error message if failed
- `width`, `height` (int)
- `captured_window_title` (str)

### EditorTabInfo
- `tab_label` (str) - Display name
- `tab_type` (str) - Asset class type
- `asset_path` (str)
- `is_foreground` (bool)

## Attaching Images for Vision Analysis

After capturing, use the `attach_image` **tool call** (NOT a Python function — call it directly like `terrain_data` or `vibeue-skills-manager`):

```
attach_image(file_path="E:/Screenshots/Capture.png")
```

- **This is a tool call**, not Python code. Do NOT put it inside `execute_python_code`.
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, BMP, GIF, WEBP
- File must exist on disk before attaching
- Image will be included in your **next** LLM request for vision analysis
- Use this after screenshots, satellite images, or any image you need to visually analyze

### Common Uses
- **Screenshots**: Capture viewport → attach → analyze what you see
- **Satellite images**: `terrain_data get_map_image` → attach → identify terrain features for material/painting
- **Blueprint graphs**: Capture editor window → attach → review node layout
- **Verification**: Capture result → attach → confirm changes look correct

## Sample scripts (run via `execute_python_code`)

- **`scripts/capture.pyx`** — capture the editor/active window or an asset editor for vision analysis.
