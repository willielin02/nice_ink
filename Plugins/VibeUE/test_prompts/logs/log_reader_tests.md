# Log Reader Tool Tests

These tests validate the `read_logs` tool functionality. Run sequentially through the VibeUE chat interface or via MCP. Tests cover listing, reading, filtering, tailing, and change detection for Unreal Engine log files.

Start with the **Quick Smoke Test** for fast validation; run the remaining parts for full coverage.
